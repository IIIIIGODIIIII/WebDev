Google has updated some of the required sections in the below tutorials and some elements have changed or no longer exist, 
but you can still follow along using the same functionality and tools that they cover. For example, you may be asked to inspect a 
button that is no longer on the page- you can still follow along and inspect existing elements without issue.

1. Head to the Chrome DevTools Documentation by Google (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). The following subsections cover 
   what you’ll be using the Developer Tools for 95% of the time. Feel free to skip the elements you are already familiar with, 
   and only read these:

    1. CSS

                1. View and change CSS (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/)
                2. CSS features reference (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/reference/)

    2. Get Started With Viewing And Changing The DOM (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/)

    3. Mobile Simulation

                1. Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/)

    4. JavaScript
                
                1. Debug JavaScript (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/) - Warning: In point 4 of step 3 of the tutorial, devtools will pause on the 
                                                                                               second line (if (inputsAreEmpty()) {) rather than at the declaration of the function. 
                                                                                               Don’t worry, this is expected.
                2. Pause your code with breakpoints (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/breakpoints/)

2. Go through the Chrome DevTools console overview (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/) to familiarize yourself with 
   the console and its usage.
